# Analysis of taxi GPS data in Porto

Find travel patterns for taxis in the city of Porto (Portugal) by analyzing taxi GPS data.

## Description

Firstly, we perform an exploratory analysis on the original dataset.

## Dataset
This dataset describes a complete year (from 01/07/2013 to 30/06/2014) of the trajectories for all the 442 taxis running in the city of Porto, in Portugal 
(i.e. one CSV file named "train.csv"). The data is available on [Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crailtap/taxi-trajectory/data).
